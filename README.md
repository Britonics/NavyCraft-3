# NavyCraft2-Lite
Public release version of the popular NavyCraft plugin. Build, drive and fight with custom ships, airplanes, tanks, and submarines! This project works on making NavyCraft more user-friendly and open for server-operators to apply to their own server. We hope to make the plugin more stable and more configurable for our users.

This "lite" version removes some of the complex features that were intended only for Naval Battlezone, and are too difficult to maintain or make configurable in a public version. The automated shipyard and associated commands have been removed, the official automated battle system has been removed, and the player rank system has also been removed. It is still possible to manually build SELECT plots and use the SPAWN system though. Note that a working shipyard, battle system, and the newest and greatest features can be found on the server at
Website: navalclash.net
Server: play.navalclash.net

This version features a better configuration setup. On first time run, the plugin will automatically generate new vehicle type files that are updated to the newest information. You can configure which EnabledWorlds the plugin will allow weapons to work in the navycraft.xml file (default is "null" to allow all worlds). Boat and airship type feature right-click style movement.
